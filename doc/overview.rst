Technical Requirements
=======================
Before creating your first Symfony application you must:

	* Install PHP 7.1 or higher and these PHP extensions (which are installed and enabled by default in most PHP 7 installations): `Ctype`_, `iconv`_, `JSON`_, `PCRE`_, `Session`_, `SimpleXML`_, and `Tokenizer`_;
	* `Install Composer`_, which is used to install PHP packages;
	* `Install Symfony`_, which creates in your computer a binary called symfony that provides all the tools you need to develop your application locally.
